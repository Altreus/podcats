    <p>The Podcats website is a very simple design and that is on purpose.
    On top of that, the style of the site is separated from the content.
    The upshot of that is that redesigning the site is as simple as replacing
    the stylesheet with a new one. The skill, therefore, lies in creating the
    stylesheet to turn a dull site interesting; and to create the site properly
    so that new stylesheets work with it.</p>

    <h3>Simplicity</h3>
    <p>Have a look at <a href="http://csszengarden.com/">this</a> site. Now
    have a look at it 
    <a href="http://csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.html">without CSS</a>.
    Our websites follow the same design principles. By keeping the site as
    simple as possible we can make the design fit your needs and alter it to
    keep up with your site changing.</p>
    <p>The ease with which we can change the design to keep up with your site's
    evolving is the obvious benefit to simplicity but there are others. 
    Consider Podcats itself. As a blog site, Podcats is likely to be visited
    by more than just people at home on their computers with their browsers.
    Some people may visit from a smartphone or an old not-so-smart phone.
    Because the content of the site is often changing, some people may wish to
    use an RSS feed to be notified of when new content arrives. Some people
    may be using a braille reader or have altered their browser to make the
    text bigger or the contrast stronger. Some people may be using screen
    readers. Still more people may wish to print it before reading it.</p>
    <p>All of these are valid ways of viewing a website. The more your own
    website can support, the more people your website is accessible to. The
    more diverse the ways you can view the website, the more people it is
    accessible to. And, of course, the more you make your site accessible to
    people who have difficulties, the more respect you, as a company, will get.
    The easier it is to navigate your site, the more the users of your site
    will appreciate it and enjoy using it. Already we see how keeping your site
    simple can aid people but really not detract from the site at all.</p>
    <p>All Podcats websites are designed to be accessible by as many people as
    possible, and we do this by keeping the site simple and effective.</p>

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>Podcats believe that information overload is the bane of the internet.
    Too often you come across websites with too much information on one page, or
    some flashy animated graphics that are all very well and good but completely
    obfuscate the site's navigation.</p>
    <p>Our site designs are therefore oriented around providing the information
    the user came for, and a bit around it to help the user to get to other 
    information. The user's experience when they visit the site is not, as you
    may think, affected by the way the site looks, but it is affected by how
    easily the website tells them what they need to know without them having to
    work for the information. Every site has a purpose: if that purpose is not
    the first thing the user sees, then no amount of fancy design is going to
    make them think it is a good website. The most basic website has a
    completely default design, like the one we linked in the second paragraph on
    this page, but if it tells you what you want to know, it is already an
    infinitely better design than any website with a good colour scheme and no
    clear purpose.</p>

    <h3>Standards</h3>
    <p>Many people do not appreciate how important it is to stick to standards
    when developing web applications. Just because Microsoft have the biggest
    market share of Internet browsers doesn't mean it's OK to just target them.
    It makes sense if you consider that the people who do not use Internet 
    Explorer are the people who are more internet-savvy, because they are the
    people who have understood why not to use Internet Explorer in the first
    place. If you make your site unusable to these people, the negative rap you
    get from their bad experiences will weigh heavily on your site and your
    company as a whole.</p>
    <p>Standards compliance ensures that your website will look and work exactly
    the same on everyone's browser. It also ensures that specialised browsers
    like braille or screen readers can cope with the site, because you will
    not have used any strange, unsupported features.</p>
    <p>All Podcats websites are W3C compliant, and this can be seen by the W3C
    logo present on all our pages. W3C is the organisation that defines the web
    standards.</p>

    <h3>Podcats Web Design</h3>
    <p>A Podcats website is therefore three things. First, it is simple. It is
    simple so that anyone can use it, and it can be used through any means. It
    is simple so that if you, as a customer, want a redesign, we can do it at
    a lower cost to you, and the original site itself is similarly a much lower
    investment.</p>
    <p>Secondly, it is usable. It has a purpose and it is not embarrassed to
    show it. It does not overload the user with unnecessary information or make
    it difficult for them to even find the information they need.</p>
    <p>Thirdly, it is standards compliant. This means that whoever uses it now
    or in the future, or even people using past technology that has served them
    well for years, will have the same experience.</p>

    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>At Podcats we are committed to using the best technology that money can
    buy. Luckily for you, as a consumer, the best technology that money can buy
    is, in fact, completely free. The only things that cost money are hardware
    and domain names. Of course, web space uses up hardware because disk space
    is a real, physical thing, so that costs money too. But the things we use to
    build the site itself are free, and hence we can deliver a site to you at
    only labour costs.</p>
    <p>Many people who use the internet have never heard of open-source 
    technology, or simply don't trust it, but at Podcats we have complete faith
    in it. Many of the Podcats themselves are contributors to open-source
    projects, and since most Podcats are Perl developers, they use open-source
    technology to contribute to open-source projects.</p>
    <p>The Podcats website itself is running on completely open-source software.
    The web server runs Debian Linux 
    (<a href="http://www.debian.org">debian.org</a>). The pages are served to 
    you by <a href="http://apache.org">Apache web server</a>. The blog is 
    powered by <a href="http://www.blosxom.com">Blosxom</a>, which is written in
    <a href="http://www.perl.org">Perl</a>, which is itself written in C
    (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)">Wikipedia
    entry</a>). JavaScript, HTML, CSS, RSS - these are all open standards.
    Absolutely nothing is proprietary. We have not paid for a single licence
    because we have used no technology that requires us to do so. All that was
    paid for were the domain name and the web space to run the site on.</p>
    <p>Many people have put time and effort into making all these technologies
    reliable and secure, from both intrusion and malicious software, and ask
    for no payment. We at Podcats are only too happy to accept their offerings
    and put them to good use by helping people who need a good website to get
    one without huge investment that they simply cannot afford.</p>

    <h3>I want one of those</h3>
    <p>If you'd like us to design you a website then simply email al @ podcats.in.
    Your email should include the purpose of the website and the things you want in it.
    You should also decide whether you want us to find you web hosting or whether you
    already have some, and the same applies to the domain name itself.</p>
    <p>Here's a quick checklist of things that you should have at least thought about
    before you email us, since these are the things we will at some point need to know
    before we can give you a definite price.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The name and purpose of your website. This should be succinct: a website
        with more than one purpose is more than one website</li>
        <li>Your target audience. This will influence the styles we give it.</li>
        <li>Features you want. For example, you might want a message board or a blog,
        or some way of syndicating content.</li>
        <li>A timescale. The same amount of work done in a shorter time will cost more,
        because things tend to take as long as they take and rushing them is a bad idea.
        </li>
    </ul>
